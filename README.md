# dist_daisy-project


This was the most difficult project I had ever done. It's adaptive and cross-browser. There are backgrounds with 
linear-gradient, unusual navigation, slider, dificult tabulation with popups inside and with mini-store in js, 
many hovers some of them with transition, menu-burger, and section with relative position and lots of absolute elements which had to be adapted.
